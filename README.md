# CYBERSECURITY PORTFOLIO

## Hands-On SOC & GRC Projects | Vulnerability Analysis | Detection Engineering | Governance, Risk & Compliance

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!
This repository serves as a central hub for all my hands-on labs, technical exercises, governance work, and learning projects.

After transitioning from a 7+ year career in hospitality and completing multiple CompTIA certifications (A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+), I built this portfolio to showcase my **practical skills**, **analytical thinking**, and **ability to investigate, report, and mitigate security issues** — the core of SOC, Blue Team, and GRC work.

## Purpose of this Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my competence and abilities in:
- Detect and analyse suspicious activity using tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Suricata, and firewalls
- Perform vulnerability scanning, interpret results, and recommend remediation actions
- Build and document network security labs from scratch using virtual machines
- Apply GRC principles, including risk assessment, control mapping, and documentation
- Communicate technical findings clearly and professionally — the same way analysts report in a SOC or GRC environment

## Final Notes

This portfolio is continually improving as I build new labs and expand my knowledge.

Every repo is made intentionally: to demonstrate what I know, how I learn, and how I think like a cybersecurity analyst.

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager viewing this — thank you for taking the time.
